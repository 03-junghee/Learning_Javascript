<HOW TO SET VARIABLES>

- When setting variables, it is good for you to write a semicolon(;) afterwards.
- If you want to use the string data type variable, you have to wrap it in quotation marks('' or "").
    Ex) name = "LeeJeongHee";
        age = 22;
- Words already in use in Javascript cannot be used as names for variables.
    Ex) class = 'math'; (X)

<HOW TO EXPRESS VARIABLES>

- When you want to express variables, you can solve it with alert() and console.log().
    Ex) alert(name);
        console.log(age);

<HOW TO MAKE VARIABLE DECLARATIONS BETTER>

- When setting a variable, use let to set a variable whose value changes.
    Ex) let age = 23;

(Whenever you declare a variable, you can use let to know whether I used this name as a variable name or not before.)

- When setting a variable, use const to set a variable whose value doesn't change.
    Ex) const PI = 3.14;

(When using const, most invariant values are used. So variable names are often capitalized to inform other users of this.)
